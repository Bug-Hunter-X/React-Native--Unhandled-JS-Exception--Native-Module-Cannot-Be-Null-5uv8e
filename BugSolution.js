The solution involves thoroughly verifying the native module's integration. Here's a structured approach:

1. **Check Installation:** Ensure that the library causing the error is correctly installed using npm or yarn. Check your package.json or yarn.lock for the library and ensure it's listed with the correct version.

2. **Check Linking:** Confirm that the native modules associated with the problematic library are correctly linked. In React Native, linking is crucial for connecting native code to JavaScript.  The linking process varies slightly depending on your project configuration and native module.

3. **Clean and Rebuild:**  Clean your project's build folders and rebuild. This often resolves issues caused by stale or corrupted build artifacts. In Android Studio, you can find the option to "Clean Project" and then "Rebuild Project". In Xcode, cleaning usually involves selecting 'Product' > 'Clean Build Folder'.

4. **Verify Podfile (iOS):** If it's an iOS issue, examine your Podfile (located in the `ios` folder of your React Native project) to ensure all necessary pods (native dependencies) are correctly specified and integrated.  Run `pod install` to update your iOS dependencies.

5. **Android Gradle:** For Android, inspect the `android/app/build.gradle` file, checking that the needed dependencies are properly included in the `dependencies` block. Sync your project in Android Studio afterwards.

6. **Check Library Documentation:** Consult the documentation of the third-party library causing the error. It may contain specific instructions for linking native modules or troubleshooting native module-related issues.

7. **Restart:** Simple, yet often overlooked.  Restart your development server and try again.

8. **Debug Mode:** Enable detailed debugging to get more specific information about the failure. 

**Example (Illustrative):**

Let's assume the library `react-native-camera` is causing the problem. You would first double-check it's installed correctly.
Then you'd verify its native modules are linked properly for both Android and iOS. If on iOS, examine the Podfile for entries related to this library.
If this doesn't fix the issue, try cleaning and rebuilding.  Consult the `react-native-camera` documentation for any specific linking or installation steps.
